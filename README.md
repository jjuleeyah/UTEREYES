# UTEREYES
# UTER-EYES Simulation

This project showcases a video demo of the UTER-EYES concept — my favorite ‘possible’ idea from an ALX Africa milestone challenge.

The simulation addresses the women’s health crisis in Africa, driven by misdiagnosis, late detection, poor health record tracking, and limited research. Data such as doctor-to-patient ratios, maternal mortality rates, and comparative analyses of gynecological and non-gynecological conditions were used to inform the solution.

The name **UTER-EYES (Uterize)** reflects the innovative and creative thinking encouraged by ALX’s entrepreneurial skills training.

The demo was recorded using OBS Studio and illustrates the early diagnostic and monitoring system concept for women’s reproductive health.
